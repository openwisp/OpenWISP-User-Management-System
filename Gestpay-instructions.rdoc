If the configuration keys are not available you are probably upgrading from an older version,
you will have to manually insert the configuration keys with the rails console unless you want
to reset all your configuration keys to the default ones (in that case just run *rake db:seed* from the command line).

To manually set the configuration keys with the console follow this procedure:

    =>:$ bundle exec rails console
    1.8.7 :001 > Configuration.set('key_name', 'value')
    # substitute key_name and value with the missing configuration keys

== Verified By Visa Notes

Verified By Visa is a service which if enabled requires the users of some credit cards to insert a special password to confirm every operation of their card.
Users of "verified by visa" or "master card security code" cards will be redirected to their bank's website to insert the special password.

For this mecchanism to work OWUMS needs to be able to communicate with OWCPM's API in order to temporary login the user so he can be redirected to the website of his bank.

TODO: write unit tests that verify that OWUMS can talk to OWCPM's API
