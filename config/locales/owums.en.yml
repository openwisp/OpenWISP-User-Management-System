    If you don't have an account, you can follow the signup procedure by going to '<strong>%{registration}</strong>' from the main menu.<br />
    Signing up requires two steps:
  "
  Register_howto_2: "
    In the first step you are required to fill in your personal data, following the given instructions on '<strong>%{registration}</strong>'.
    Signing up <strong>requires an Italian mobile phone number</strong>. In case you don't have one the Help Desk will signup for you if you
    can provide valid ID.<br />
    After filling up the forms with your info, to use the service it's required that the data is verified. Most of the times the verification
    step is made by calling (no charge applied) with your mobile phone (the one used in the signup form). The verification procedure only works if
    <strong>the telephone number of the caller is not hidden</strong> and the mobile phone number is an Italian number.<br />
    In case the previous conditions are not met, you will not be able to use the service. After the verifications step is complete, you will be
    taken to your personal, private page. To use the service, it'll be enough to open a new page (i.e. www.google.com) to begin browsing.
